## Change Log
**Version 1.1a (5/21/2018)**
- Project Document Descriptions: Allow people to provide a description for each project document that is associated with a project.
- Bulk Project Deletion: New feature allows a person to do bulk deletion of projects, in particular helpful in cleaning up old imported data.
- Projects with No Contacts: When viewing a project that has no contacts, a box is displayed directing the user to contact EECIP support to obtain assistance in determining a project contact for them.
- Multiple Project URLs: Allow people to input multiple hyperlinks to additional project information, and provide a description of each. This will allow project owners to, for example, link to a project document as well as a functioning project website.
- Exclude from Badges/Points: Allow a person to exclude him/herself from the points leaderboard. Also allows Administrators to do this for anyone. 
- Enhanced Features for EECIP Administrators:
   - Data Export: Administrators can now go to a new Admin --> Data Export page to export all Projects and/or Enterprise Services in the database 
   - Better Governance Group/Agency Separation (for Administrators): In the administration menu, separated out the administration of Agencies from Governance Groups, to make it more intuitive.
   - Data Import Templates: Now on the Data Import page, links are provided allowing the Administrator to download the latest import templates.
